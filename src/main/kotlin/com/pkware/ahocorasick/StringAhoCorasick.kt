/**
 * An Aho-Corasick structure optimized for strings which uses a low amount of memory.
 *
 * One can populate this structure by repeatedly calling [add] and then calling [build] once all strings have been
 * added.
 *
 * This structure builds on top of [AhoCorasickBase], using only ~5 `int`s per entry by having each string added to this
 * structure associated with its length. Given the location a match was found at, along with a length, the original key
 * can then be calculated again and returned in a [AhoCorasickResult]. This prevents one from having to keep any of the
 * original strings in memory. This does mean that if [isCaseSensitive] is `false`, __the result will have the casing in
 * the input text__. Eg: With the key `cat`, and the input `CaT`, the value returned would be `CaT`. If one needs to
 * preserve casing, the generic form of this structure, [AhoCorasick], should be used at the cost of more memory.
 *
 * @param options Options which change the default key matching behavior.
